# Int Agents Project

## Description
The repository contains an obstacle avoidance for mobile robots using deep reinforcement learning. The robot learng to avoid collisions with obstacles while reaching a specified goal in the environment. For this purpose a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm was implemented and trained on simulation data from ROS stage. For more information please see the paper in the documentation folder.
